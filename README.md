Atlant.bh Code Challenge

Thesw files represent calculatios of all possible solutions.
For 10 lego blocks you can make pillars like 1-9, 2-8 ... 4-6 or
pillars like 1-2-7, 1-3-6 and so on and pillars like 1-2-3-4.

So in translation, we need all subset sums of n-1 that sum up to n
tanking in the fact that you can have minimum of 2 pillars.
